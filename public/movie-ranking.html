<h3>Dune Part 1</h3>
<p>
  "This is an epic that shows scale ive never seen before,<br />
  a complex story thats condensed very well in space which is cool."
</p>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
  "Shawshank put you through every emotion from super sad and emotional to
  angery to happy and calm,<br />
  while being perfectly paced an shot, really well making you part of the prison
  group of friends."
</p>
<h3>Avengers Infinity War</h3>
<p>
  "Avengers Infinity War is the culmination of over a decade of movies that ive
  been watching<br />
  and seeing all those characters that ive grown up with in one massive movie
  was epic<br />
  and at the end not knowing what comes next was awesome to experience with a
  crowd."
